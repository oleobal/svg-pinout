Formatting :

Four sections : top, bottom, left, right, for where you want the pins to be.
To start a section, write its name (case-insensitive) with a # in front :
pin descriptions that follow will belong to that section.
Sections can be called multiple times.

Pins can be :
  ground pin
  1 ground pin
So either a name or a number and a name.

Instead of a number, you can also specify an (inclusive) range, like this :
  0-7 I/O
Alternatively, specify a number of pins, like this :
  8x I/O
They'll be numbered automatically.

Pins with no number are automatically assigned one.
Pins with no section are divided between top and bottom, to varying results.
Pins with no color are black.

That's right, you can specify color. It works like sections :
  # blue
will color everything after it blue. You can use any CSS color name or code.
You can go back to the default color (likely black or white) with `# nocolor`.

You can add an alignment mark to a section by calling `# mark`.

Empty line and lines starting with # that are more than one word (whitespace
notwithstanding) are ignored. To provide for a sure way of writing comments,
lines starting with ## are always ignored.
