# 12AX7 (ECC83) Vacuum tube dual triode (amplifier)
# This is where we realise round things exist

# The 12AX7 works like a modern transistor.
# The grid would be the base, the cathode the collector,
# and the anode the emitter.
# (or is it reversed ? I never remember)

# But first heat the cathode with the Heater pins.
# (the center tap allows you to supply it in 12 or 6V)
# Also, it costs like 10 bucks.
# Transistors are better.
