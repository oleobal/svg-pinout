# Intel 4004

# The very first microprocessor ever commercialized.
# The Intel 8008 was in development earlier, but since Intel
# did not care at the time (they were more into memory),
# they were slacking.

# The 4004 was part of the MCS-4 family, state-of-the-art
# chips for a new calculator for the Japanese
# company Busicom.
# Intel did no work for months, and hired Federico Faggin to
# work on it the day just before the client came to visit.
# He proceeded to work on the project with maximum effort,
# but nowadays he's not even mentioned on the 4004 page on
# Intel's website.
