// Intel 4004

// The very first microprocessor ever commercialized.
// The Intel 8008 was in development earlier, but since Intel
// did not care at the time (they were more into memory),
// they were slacking.

// The 4004 was part of the MCS-4 family, state-of-the-art
// chips for a new calculator for the Japanese
// company Busicom.
// Intel did no work for months, and hired Federico Faggin to
// work on it the day just before the client came to visit.
// He proceeded to work on the project with maximum effort,
// but nowadays he's not even mentioned on the 4004 page on
// Intel's website.
