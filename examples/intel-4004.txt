# Intel 4004

# The very first microprocessor ever commercialized.
# The Intel 8008 was in development earlier, but since Intel did not care
# at the time (they were more into memory), they were slacking.

# The 4004 was part of the MCS-4 family, state-of-the-art chips for a new
# calculator for the Japanese company Busicom.
# Intel did no work for months, and hired Federico Faggin to work on it the
# day just before the client came to visit. He proceded to work on the project
# with maximum effort, but nowadays he's not even mentioned on the 4004 page
# on Intel's website.
