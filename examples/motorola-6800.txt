# Motorola 6800

# The 6800 was similar to the Intel 8080.
# Unfortunately for both of them, Federico Faggin quit Intel
# around the same time to found Zilog, and released
# the Z80 soon after, which was better than both.

# It is still the obvious and significant predecessor
# to the Motorola 68000, which was and still is widely
# used in various devices.
